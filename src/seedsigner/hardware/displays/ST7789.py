        # SLPOUT (Sleep Out): wake the display from its post-reset sleep state.
        # The ST7789 datasheet requires at least 120 ms between SLPOUT and any
        # subsequent command (including DISPON).  Without this delay the display
        # ignores DISPON and stays blank.
        #
        # Why the bug was hidden with kernel-managed CE but not with CS-to-GND:
        #
        # Two separate effects compound:
        #
        # 1) Code path: SPI_NO_CS support and lazy init were introduced together.
        #    Users on the default kernel-CE path were still running the original
        #    eager-init code (init() called in __init__()), so hundreds of
        #    milliseconds of application startup — settings load, controller
        #    construction, initial view build — passed between SLPOUT and the first
        #    pixel write, accidentally covering the 120 ms requirement.  Users
        #    switching to CS-to-GND were necessarily on the new code that also
        #    introduced lazy init, removing that accidental gap entirely (init()
        #    runs immediately before show_image() with nothing in between).
        #
        # 2) Hardware: with kernel-managed CE wired to LCD CS, the Linux SPI
        #    driver pulses CE HIGH between every individual spi.transfer() call.
        #    That CS deassert/reassert edge after SLPOUT gives the ST7789 a
        #    synchronisation point; the chip's state machine can detect the end of
        #    the SLPOUT frame and begin its internal wake sequence.  With CS tied
        #    permanently to GND there is never a CE HIGH pulse — the display sees
        #    an unbroken clock stream and has no edge to synchronise on, making it
        #    sensitive to the exact inter-command timing.  Using SPI Mode 3
        #    (SCK idles HIGH, configured automatically when cs="disabled") also
        #    helps here by ensuring boot-time SCK transitions do not corrupt the
        #    display's shift register before init() runs (see TFT_eSPI issue #163).
        #
        # The sleep below is the correct fix: it satisfies the datasheet timing
        # regardless of how CS is managed or which init path is taken.
